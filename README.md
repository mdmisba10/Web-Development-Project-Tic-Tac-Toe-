Project Description: Tic Tac Toe Game
Overview
For my first web development project, I built a classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project not only marks my initial foray into web development but also serves as a foundational piece to demonstrate my understanding of the core web technologies.

Features :-
Interactive Gameplay: Players can take turns marking Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid.

Winning Logic: The game includes logic to determine when a player has won or when the game ends in a draw, with corresponding messages displayed to the players.

Restart Functionality: A button allows players to restart the game without refreshing the page, resetting the board and game state.


Technologies Used :-

HTML: Provides the basic structure of the game board and UI components.

CSS: Adds styling to the game, ensuring an engaging and user-friendly interface.

JavaScript: Implements the game logic, including player moves, win detection, and game reset functionality.


Key Learnings :-

DOM Manipulation: Gained experience in manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) to update the game board in real time based on user interactions.

Event Handling: Learned how to use event listeners to handle player moves and other interactions.

CSS Flexbox: Utilized Flexbox for creating a responsive layout that adjusts smoothly to different screen sizes.

Game Logic: Developed and refined the logic to check for winning combinations and handle game state management.
Future Improvements


Future Improvements :-

AI Opponent: Implement a basic AI to allow for single-player mode against the computer.

Animations: Add animations to make the game more visually dynamic, such as transitions when a player makes a move or when the game ends.

Score Tracking: Implement a feature to keep track of wins and draws over multiple games.

Advanced Styling: Enhance the visual design with more sophisticated CSS techniques and possibly integrate a CSS framework like Bootstrap.

This Tic Tac Toe project is a significant milestone in my web development journey, providing a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while also being a fun and engaging application.
